- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OakenAle, an artist that does potato stuff. I mostly focus my energy into 3D generalist stuff.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating games from scratch, I have just finised a bachelor in 3D Animation, 3D generalist and digital art. I have a few projects going on, mainly my bachelor project set to release on steam in 2024. 
- ğŸ“« For now you can reach me on Oakenale@gmail.com
